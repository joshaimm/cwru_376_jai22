##### Welcome!

* Please be sure to check out the Wiki for useful information.

##### Students
* Student groups who are forking this repository, please don't forget to replace student in the name of your repo to your group number/name.
* Code will be run on the robots during development by setting up your computer to publish and subscribe to a ROS master located over network on one of the physical robots.  After you get the smaller kinks worked out, you will "deploy" your code by cloning your groups repository locally on the robot and running your code directly from there.
